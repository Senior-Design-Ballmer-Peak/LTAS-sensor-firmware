To make your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W discoverable via Bluetooth, you'll need to set it up as a Bluetooth server. This involves installing and configuring Bluetooth software and then setting the device to be discoverable. Below are the general steps you would follow on a Raspberry Pi running a Debian-based OS like Raspberry Pi OS:

### 1. Update and Upgrade Your Raspberry Pi
First, ensure your Raspberry Pi is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### 2. Install Bluetooth Support
Install the necessary Bluetooth management tools:

```bash
sudo apt install bluetooth bluez blueman
```

### 3. Enable the Bluetooth Service
Enable and start the Bluetooth service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

### 4. Make the Raspberry Pi Discoverable
To make your Raspberry Pi discoverable, you need to set the discoverable mode on. This can usually be done by editing the Bluetooth configuration file or using command-line utilities.

#### Using Command Line
You can use the `bluetoothctl` tool for this purpose. Enter the tool's interactive mode:

```bash
sudo bluetoothctl
```

Then, in the `bluetoothctl` prompt, enter the following commands:

- `power on` to turn the Bluetooth power on
- `agent on` to enable the Bluetooth agent that handles pairing
- `discoverable on` to make the device discoverable
- `pairable on` to make the device pairable

Your Raspberry Pi should now be discoverable. You can check by scanning for Bluetooth devices from a smartphone or computer.

#### Editing Bluetooth Configuration (Optional)
Alternatively, you can edit the Bluetooth configuration file to make these changes persistent across reboots. Edit `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` and ensure the following lines are set (or add them if they are missing):

```ini
[General]
DiscoverableTimeout = 0 # Makes the device always discoverable
```

After making changes, restart the Bluetooth service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

### 5. Connecting Devices
When another device discovers your Raspberry Pi, you'll need to pair and possibly trust the device using `bluetoothctl` commands like `pair [device]`, `trust [device]`, and `connect [device]`, where `[device]` is the Bluetooth address of the device trying to connect.

### Troubleshooting
- If your Raspberry Pi is not discoverable after these steps, try rebooting it.
- Ensure your Raspberry Pi's Bluetooth is not blocked by rfkill: `rfkill list` and `sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth`.
- Check the status of the Bluetooth service for errors: `sudo systemctl status bluetooth`.

This guide should help you make your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W discoverable via Bluetooth. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check the Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth communities for specific troubleshooting tips.
